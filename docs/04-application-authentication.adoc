== Abstract

This document describes the setup of two authentication processes for
applications running in Google Container Engine (GKE).

The first process is
based on the Google Cloud IAM API and works on every version of GKE. It is
suitable for usage in applications running in old versions of GKE.

The second process is based on the `TokenReview` API of Kubernetes and works on GKE
clusters running Kubernetes 1.7.8 and higher. It is the recommended approach for
new clusters.

.Applications in different clusters and projects communicating with Vault.
image::architecture.png[Architecture,75%]

The proposed configuration allows for applications running in separate clusters
and projects to access Vault, providing an effective inter-cluster,
inter-project solution.

For the remainder of the document it is assumed that
Vault 0.8.3 is running on GKE and that it is publicly accessible at
`https://vault.example.com`.

== Pre-Requisites

* The `vault` binary.
* The https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] binary.
* Being authenticated as `root` in Vault.
* A set of policies pre-configured in Vault.

One is also expected to be familiar with the Vault documentation,
in particular with

* the
https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html[Getting Started]
guide;
* the
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/lease.html[Lease, Renew, and Revoke]
docs;
* the
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/auth.html[Authentication]
docs;
* the
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html[Policies]
docs.

To a lesser extent, one is also expected to have read the docs for the
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp.html[Google Cloud] and
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes.html[Kubernetes] backends.

== Overview of the Authentication Process

Vault 0.8.3 supports authentication using either Google Cloud IAM
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts[*_service accounts_*]
or Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/service-accounts-admin/[*_service accounts_*].
This is achieved using the https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp.html[`gcp`]
and https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes.html[`kubernetes`]
authentication backends, respectively. These backends allows Vault
administrators to define *_roles_*, and applications to request Vault
*_authentication tokens_* associated with these roles.

[INFO]
====
A *_role_* is a set of
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html[*_policies_*] which
control what secrets an application can access.
====

The flow of the `gcp` and `kubernetes` authentication backends consists of four
steps:

. The application obtains a *_signed token_* representing its identity. This
  token can either be
  .. a token requested from the Google Cloud IAM API; or
  .. the service account token mounted by Kubernetes on the pod in which the
     application runs.
. The application sends the signed token to Vault in a *_login request_* for a
  given role.
. Vault verifies the authenticity of the signed token using respectively
  .. the Google Cloud IAM API; or
  .. the source Kubernetes cluster's API.
. If verification is successful Vault returns an *_authentication token_* to the
  application. This token can be used by the application to request secrets from
  the Vault API, subject to the policies associated with the role.

[TIP]
====
In each scenario *_authentication_* is delegated to an external entity. However,
*_authorization_* is always managed within Vault via the abovementioned roles.
It is important to understand that IAM roles or Kubernetes `Roles` or
`ClusterRoles` associated with the service accounts *do not* have any meaning
within Vault.
====

== Configuring Google Cloud IAM Authentication

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order to use Google Cloud IAM as an authentication method one must enable the
_Google Identity and Access Management (IAM)_ API in the project where Vault is
deployed. One can enable the API via the Google Cloud Platform Console by
navigating to

_APIs & services_ → _Dashboard_ → _Enable APIs & Services_

and searching for _Google Identity and Access Management (IAM)_, or by running

`gcloud --project <project-id> service-management enable iam.googleapis.com`

on a terminal, replacing `<project-id>` with the ID of the project where Vault
is deployed.
====

=== Creating a Service Account for Authentication

One must start by creating a Google Cloud IAM service account which Vault will
use to verify the authenticity of signed tokens. This account must be created on
the project where Vault is deployed. In order to create the account one must run

[source,bash]
----
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create \
>    vault-authn \
>    --display-name "Vault AuthN" \
>    --project <project-id>
Created service account [vault-authn].
$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
>    vault-authn.json \
>    --iam-account vault-authn@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
>    --key-file-type json
created key [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx] of type [json] as [vault-authn.json] for [vault-authn@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com]
----
<1> One may choose a different name for the service account, other than `vault-authn`.
<2> One may choose a different display name for the service account, other than `Vault AuthN`.
<3> One must replace `<project-id>` with the ID of the project where Vault is deployed.
<4> One may choose a different filename or path for the service account's private key, other than `vault-authn.json`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This service account must be granted the following IAM roles *_on each project hosting client applications_*:

* _Service Accounts_ → _Service Account Key Admin_
* _Service Accounts_ → _Service Account Token Creator_
====

One can grant the needed roles via the Google Cloud Platform Console by navigating to

_IAM & admin_ → _IAM_ → _Add_

or by running

[source,bash]
----
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <client-project-id> \
>    --member \
>    serviceAccount:vault-authn@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
>    --role \
>    roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
bindings: (...)
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <client-project-id> \
>    --member \
>    serviceAccount:vault-authn@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
>    --role \
>    roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
bindings: (...)
----
<1> One must replace `<client-project-id>` with the ID of the project where the
    client application is deployed.
<2> One must replace `<project-id>` with the ID of the project where Vault
    is deployed.
<3> If one has choosen a different name for the service account one must change
    it here.

=== Enabling Vault's `gcp` Authentication Backend

To enable the `gcp` auth backend one must run

[source,bash]
----
$ vault auth-enable gcp
Successfully enabled 'gcp' at 'gcp'!
----

Then, one must configure the `gcp` auth backend by providing it with the
private key of the service account used to validate signed tokens:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write auth/gcp/config credentials=@vault-authn.json
Success! Data written to: auth/gcp/config
----
<1> If one has chosen a different filename or path for the service account's
    private key one must update this command accordingly.

=== Creating Roles

In order to create roles one must run:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write auth/gcp/role/<role-name> \
>    type="iam" \
>    project_id="<client-project-id>" \
>    bound_service_accounts="..." \
>    policies="..." \
>    period="<ttl>"
Success! Data written to: auth/gcp/role/<role-name>
----
<1> One must replace `<role-name>` by the actual role name.
<2> One must replace `<client-project-id>` by the ID of the project that hosts
    the client applications.
<3> One must replace `...` by a comma-separated list of service account IDs that
    can login with this role.
<4> One must replace `...` by a comma-separated list of policies to associate
    with the role.
<5> One must replace `<ttl>` by the desired time-to-live for the authentication tokens.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The fact that `project_id` accepts a single value as input means that at least
one role must be created for every GCP project hosting a client application.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Every service account specified in `bound_service_accounts` must belong to the
project specified in `<client-project-id>`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The fact that one is specifying a `period` instead of a `ttl` means that
authentication tokens have to be renewed every `<ttl>` seconds to be kept valid.
====

[TIP]
====
The `bound_service_accounts` and `policies` properties enable fine-grained
control over what secrets applications can access. One is encouraged to create
as many roles as necessary to keep access to secrets under tight control and to
avoid granting too much privileges to a given account.
====

[TIP]
====

https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/gcp/index.html[GCP Auth Plugin HTTP API].

== Configuring Kubernetes Authentication

=== Enabling Vault's `kubernetes` Authentication Backend

To enable the `kubernetes` authentication backend one must run:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault auth-enable --path "<client-project-id>-<cluster-name>" kubernetes
Successfully enabled 'gcp' at '<client-project-id>-<cluster-name>'!
----
<1> One must replace `<client-project-id>` with the ID of the project where the
    client application is deployed.
<2> One must replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of the cluster where the
    client application is deployed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Every Kubernetes cluster that requires access to Vault needs its own instance of
the `kubernetes` authentication backend.
====

Finally, one must configure the `kubernetes` auth backend by providing it with
the URL of the Kubernetes API and with the CA certificate for the cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ KUBERNETES_HOST=$(gcloud container clusters describe \
>    <cluster-name> \
>    --format json \
>    --project <client-project-id> | jq -r .endpoint)
$ KUBERNETES_CA_CERT=$(gcloud container clusters describe \
>    <cluster-name> \
>    --format json \
>    --project <client-project-id> | jq -r .masterAuth.clusterCaCertificate | base64 -D)
$ vault write auth/<client-project-id>-<cluster-name>/config \
>    kubernetes_host="https://${KUBERNETES_HOST}" \
>    kubernetes_ca_cert="${KUBERNETES_CA_CERT}"
Success! Data written to: auth/<client-project-id>-<cluster-name>/config
----
<1> One must replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of the cluster where the
    client application is deployed.
<2> One must replace `<client-project-id>` with the ID of the project where the
    client application is deployed.
<3> Depending on the Unix flavor one is running, `base64 -D` may have to be
    replaced with `base64 -d`.

=== Creating Roles

In order to create roles one must run:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write auth/<client-project-id>-<cluster-name>/role/<role-name> \
>    bound_service_account_names="..." \
>    bound_service_account_namespaces="..." \
>    policies="..." \
>    period="<ttl>"
Success! Data written to: auth/<client-project-id>-<cluster-name>/role/<role-name>
----
<1> One must replace `<client-project-id>` with the ID of the project where the
    client application is deployed.
<2> One must replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of the cluster where the
    client application is deployed.
<3> One must replace `<role-name>` by the actual role name.
<4> One must replace `...` with a comma-separated list of service accounts that
    can login with this role.
<5> One must replace `...` by a comma-separated list of namespaces where the
    abovementioned service accounts can login with this role.
<6> One must replace `...` by a comma-separated list of policies to associate
    with the role.
<7> One must replace `<ttl>` by the desired time-to-live for the authentication
    tokens.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The fact that one is specifying a `period` instead of a `ttl` means that
authentication tokens have to be renewed every `<ttl>` seconds to be kept valid.
====

[TIP]
====
The `bound_service_account_names`, `bound_service_account_namespaces` and
`policies` properties enable fine-grained control over what secrets applications
can access. One is encouraged to create as many roles as necessary to keep
access to secrets under tight control and to avoid granting too much privileges
to a given account.
====

[TIP]
====

https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/kubernetes/index.html[Kubernetes Auth Plugin HTTP API].
====

=== RBAC configuration

If the GKE cluster in which a client application is deployed has
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC] enabled it is
necessary to perform an extra step—authorize every service account in use to
access the `TokenReview` API. This can be made by creating a
`ClusterRoleBinding` which includes all combinations of service account and
namespace that will authenticate with Vault:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: vault-tokenreview-binding
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:auth-delegator
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <service-account-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
----
<1> The binding can have as many subjects as necessary.
<2> One must replace `<service-account-name>` with the name of a service
    account.
<3> One must replace `<namespace>` with the name of a namespace in which the
    abovementioned service account will be used to access Vault.
